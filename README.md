# Genetic algorithm for the Binary Knapsack Problem
This project contains an implementation of a genetic algorithm that finds the optimal solution to the binary knapsack problem. The project was carried out as part of the "Efficient Programming Techniques" course during my 3rd semester of studies.

The data is passed from a text file with the format:

```
weights of particular items
values of particular items
capacity
```

The data.txt file is an exemplary dataset used in the program.
